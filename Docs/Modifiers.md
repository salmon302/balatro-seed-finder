Modifiers are upgrades that can be applied to cards that provide various benefits, such as improved scoring capability, creating consumables, money generation, or card manipulation. There are 4 types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, Seals, and Stickers.

Playing cards may each have one Enhancement, one Edition, and one Seal. When copied using  DNA,  Cryptid, or  Death, the duplicate will retain all the modifiers from the original card.
Jokers may have one Edition and multiple Stickers. Some stakes and some Challenge runs enable stickers to be applied to jokers like the Eternal, the Perishable and/or the Rental stickers, providing some in-run changes. A Sticker cannot be changed or removed. When copied with  Invisible Joker or  Ankh, it will copy both the Edition (except for Negatives) and Sticker of the original Joker.
Consumables (Tarot Cards, Planet Cards and Spectral Cards) can't have any modifiers normally, but can only be spawned with a Negative modifier using the Legendary Joker  Perkeo.
Vouchers cannot have any modifiers.

Applying a modifier to a card that already has that type (for example, applying a Red Seal to a card that already has a Blue Seal) will replace the previous modifier with the new one. Whenever a modifier is applied to a card, it retains the upgrade for the rest of the run. Editions are permanent and cannot be overwritten.

In general, modifiers are applied to Jokers and playing cards by Tarot or Spectral cards. Modified cards can also be found in Booster Packs or purchased directly from the Shop by having the  Magic Trick and/or Illusion voucher.

Debuffed cards and Jokers (from Boss Blinds or Challenge Decks) have all modifier effects disabled except for Negative (+1 slot) and Stone (no rank and suit). Debuffed wild cards revert back into their original suit.

Stickers
See Stickers for more information about  Eternal,  Perishable and  Rental modifiers on Jokers.

Appearance Rates
When generating cards at random (through the Shop, Booster Packs, etc), not all modifiers are equally likely. The chance for a modifier to get applied not only depends on the modifier, but also on the type of card, and on purchased Vouchers.

Jokers
Vouchers	Edition chance	Sticker chance
Negative	Poly	Holo	Foil	Eternal	Perishable	Rental
None	0.3%	0.3%	1.4%	2%	30%	30%	30%
Hone	0.9%	2.8%	4%
Glow Up	2.1%	5.6%	8%
See the Stickers page for more information about Stickers.

Playing Cards
Vouchers	Edition chance	Enhancement chance	Seal chance
Poly	Holo	Foil
None	1.2%	2.8%	4%	40%	20%
Hone	2.4%	5.6%	8%
Glow Up	4.8%	11.2%	16%
The chance of getting each Enhancement/Seal is evenly distributed over their variants. This is for Booster Packs only, as the Illusion Voucher uses a different distribution for Modifiers. Illusion is bugged such that it never spawns seals, and is unaffected by Hone/Glow Up.

Usage Notes
Tarot Cards like  The Chariot, or  The Empress can be used to add an enhancement to the current playing cards in the deck.
 Familiar,  Incantation and  Grim can add random enhanced cards at the cost of destroying one card from the deck.
 Midas Mask is the only Joker that can add an enhancement to played scored cards.
 Vampire can remove enhancements from played scoring cards.
Having a large hand size when opening an Arcana pack can make it easier to enhance desired cards.
Editions can only be added to existing playing cards using  Aura.
Seals can be added to playing cards in your deck using Spectral Cards.
 Talisman adds a Gold Seal,  Deja Vu adds a Red Seal,  Trance adds a Blue Seal, and  Medium adds a Purple Seal.
New playing cards with a Seal can be added to your deck through Standard Packs, or  Certificate.
Gold Seals and Blue Seals can be reactivated using Jokers.
For example,  Sock and Buskin can reactivate a Gold Seal Queen, and give you an additional $3.
Red Seals will not be reactivated a second time with Jokers such as  Mime or  Hack.
For example, after playing a Red Seal 2, it will only activate once for the initial trigger, once for  Hack, and once more for the Red Seal. It will be activated three times.
Jokers already in the player's possession can only obtain Editions through  The Wheel of Fortune,  Ectoplasm and  Hex.
To guarantee a Joker has an edition in the next Shop, a blind can be skipped to get a  Polychrome Tag,  Foil Tag,  Negative Tag or  Holographic Tag.
