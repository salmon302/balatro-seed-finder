Two Booster Packs are always offered in each Shop, often but not always of two different types. These come in five categories:

Arcana Packs, containing Tarot Cards for immediate use.
Celestial Packs, containing Planet Cards for immediate use.
Standard Packs, containing Playing Cards (often with Enhancements, Seals and/or Editions) that are added into your deck.
Buffoon Packs, containing Joker Cards to add to your run.
Spectral Packs, containing Spectral Cards for immediate use.
A new set of Booster Packs will be offered with each shop. Booster Packs do not refresh when rerolling the Shop.

Purchasing a Booster Pack opens it immediately, where it then reveals multiple card options for the player to choose. For Tarot and Spectral Packs, a hand of Playing Cards equal to the player's current hand size is dealt for the player to apply effects on. The player is able to use any consumables they currently have in their Consumable Slots before selecting a Tarot or Spectral card, however, for Normal and Jumbo packs all cards will be removed upon selecting one of the cards offered, while Mega Packs allow the player to use one card offered before using their consumables. The player is not required to select an option and can choose to skip if no cards offered are appealing or potentially detrimental to the player's current run. Skipping a booster pack will increase  Red Card's current Mult by 3 Mult; this includes skipping a mega pack after selecting only one of the cards being offered.

Each category of Booster Pack comes in three Sizes - Normal, Jumbo and Mega - with each providing more choice than the previous one. Within each Size, there is a variety of artwork which can be shown on the Booster Pack; this does not affect the behavior of the Booster Pack.

Booster Pack Rates
The Booster Packs offered to the player are determined using different probabilities based on their Type and Size. Each Booster Pack has a weight assigned to it, which determines how likely it is to be selected; for instance, a Jumbo Arcana Pack has four times the likelihood to be offered than a Mega Arcana Pack, but is half as likely to be offered as a Normal Arcana Pack.

Name	Normal Pack	Chance To Appear	Jumbo Pack	Chance To Appear	Mega Pack	Chance To Appear
Standard, Arcana, or Celestial Pack	4	53.52%	2	26.76%	0.5	6.69%
Buffoon Pack	1.2	5.35%	0.6	2.67%	0.15	0.66%
Spectral Pack	0.6	2.67%	0.3	1.34%	0.075	0.31%
Trivia
It is possible to softlock the game during a Arcana/Spectral Pack opening if you have 0 cards left to apply effects to. You can remove cards from the drawn hand using e.g.  Immolate or  The Hanged Man. Once there are 0 cards left in your hand, the game greys out the skip button and will not allow you to use any consumables that apply effects. Other consumables that do not apply effects to cards like  Temperance or  The Hermit will still work.
The "MEGA" text on Mega Booster Packs mimicks the style of the Metallica logo.
Booster packs follow a set order of consumables specific to each seed. This means if a shop has two of the exact same booster packs, opening both packs in any order will yield the same result.
In the cover of all of the booster packs, except for all of the Standard Packs and 2 normal Spectral Packs, there is a joker or a consumable card that is represented. In the order of the Collection, the represented cards are:
For the Arcana Packs:  The Fool,  Temperance,  The Hierophant,  The World,  Death (Jumbo),  The Emperor (Jumbo),  The Tower (Mega), and  The Hermit (Mega).
For the Celestial Packs:  Mercury,  Jupiter,  Earth,  Uranus,  Mars (Jumbo),  Pluto (Jumbo),  Saturn (Mega), and  Venus (Mega).
For the Buffoon Packs:  Hack,  Juggler,  Banner (Jumbo), and  Brainstorm (Mega).
For the Spectral Packs:  Incantation (Jumbo) and  Ectoplasm (Mega).
