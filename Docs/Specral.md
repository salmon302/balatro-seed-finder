Spectral Cards are a form of consumable obtainable during a run. They can also be seen in their dedicated tab in the Collection.

Spectral cards bear a resemblance to Tarot cards in that their general trait is to modify playing cards in the deck, though this time to a much greater extent, providing considerably better perks. To balance these drastic effects out, Spectral cards tend to also have massive drawbacks that can meaningfully hinder the run, leading the player into a high-risk high-reward style of play. The disadvantages range from setting money to $0, to destroying Jokers, to reducing hand size. All 18 Spectral cards are readily accessible on a fresh account with no unlocking required, but one would only be able to find them in Booster Packs. There are also ways to put Spectral cards in the consumable slots, be it through certain Jokers or acquired through the Shop, but keep in mind the second method is only available to those on  Ghost Deck.

Any Spectral card has an equal chance of appearing, with the exclusion of  The Soul and  Black Hole. Booster Packs are the only way to obtain these consumables, having only a 0.3% chance to appear for every card found in a Spectral Pack, as well as Arcana Packs for The Soul and Celestial Packs for Black Hole. Any other method of obtaining Spectral cards, such as  SÃ©ance or  Sixth Sense, as well as using  Ghost Deck, are not able to generate these two special Spectral cards.

Usage Notes
Spectral Cards, like Jokers and other Consumables, normally can't have duplicates in the shop or Booster Packs without  Showman. If all 18 Spectral Cards are in the player's possession, subsequent Spectral Card spawns will always be  Incantation.
 Omen Globe allows for Spectral Cards to appear in Arcana Packs as well.
Trivia

While other consumables, such as Tarots and Planets, are based on predefined sets, Spectral Cards are more unique as they do not belong to any previously established collection.
Spectral Cards seem to deal with supernatural and spiritual objects, spells, events and creatures that affect ordinary objects or people in some way.
