Poker Hands are sets of one to five cards that can be played in Balatro to obtain Chips and Mult for scoring. Each hand also has a level that affects its potency. In general, the more difficult it is to play a certain Poker Hand, the higher its base score will be. For example, a Pair will score for much less than a Four of a Kind.

At the beginning of a run, all Hands start at Level 1, and are generally upgraded through Planet cards. Hands can also be upgraded with the Orbital Tag, the  Black Hole Spectral card,  Burnt Joker, and  Space Joker. The level can also be permanently decreased by  The Arm. There is no limit to how many times a Poker Hand can be leveled up. Furthermore, the Poker Hand levels are reset back to Level 1 each time when starting a new run.

Higher-tier hands take precedence over lower-tier hands regardless of their level or scoring. For example, if the hand is 9 9 9 9 2, and all of them are diamonds, the hand will always be a Four of a Kind and never a Flush. By selecting the desired cards before playing them, it is possible to check which Poker Hand it will count as on the left-hand side, over the scoreboard. An exception to this is when playing against a Boss Blind that turns cards in hand face down, which, when selected will make the poker hand name appear as "???" until it is played.

Generally, only the cards relevant to the hand are scored. All others are not scored. For example, if an Ace is played as a High Card with 4 other cards, only the High Card base amount and the Ace's values are used for the hand's score. The other cards (up to 4) are just discarded and have no effect. However, sometimes it can be beneficial to play extra cards as an extra discard while still having the main hand score. This would not work with any hand that requires five cards to be played. The main exceptions to this rule are with  Splash, which explicitly allows all played cards to be scored, with  Four Fingers, which can be used to score a Straight that contains two cards of matching rank (A A K Q J); and with Stone Cards to gain an extra +50 Chips.

Secret Poker Hands
There are three "secret" Poker Hands that are only possible through adding more playing cards to the deck, or changing existing cards with Consumables or Jokers. These Poker Hands will not appear in the Run Info screen until they have been played at least once, after which they will show up on the info menu, and their respective Planet Cards will be obtainable only during the current run. These Poker Hands will also be upgraded by  Black Hole, even before they are unlocked.

Poker Hand	Base Scoring	How to Play the Hand	Example
Five of a Kind	120 Chips x 12 Mult	Five cards with the same rank which are not all the same suit.	    
Flush House	140 Chips x 14 Mult	Three cards with the same rank, and two cards with the same rank, all from a single suit.	    
Flush Five	160 Chips x 16 Mult	Five cards with the same rank and same suit.	    
Additional Notes
The exact judgment criteria of a Straight Flush is "any hand which is both a Straight and a Flush". With  Four Fingers, it's possible to make a Straight Flush with such cards as 9♠️ 8♠️ 7♥️ 6♠️ 3♠️. Additionally, a Royal Flush is "a Straight Flush with all cards of rank 10 or higher".
Similarly, the exact judgment criteria of a Flush House is "any hand which is both a Full House and a Flush". With  Four Fingers, it's possible to make a Flush House with such cards as 8♠️ 8♠️ 8♥️ 6♠️ 6♠️.
In much the same way, the exact judgement criteria of Flush Five is "any hand which is both Five of a Kind and a Flush." With Four Fingers, it's possible to make a Flush Five with 5 cards of the same rank, of which only 4 are of the same suit.
Two Pair and Full House require that the cards are of different ranks. Thus, Four of a Kind, Five of a Kind, and Flush Five do not contain Two Pair, and Five of a Kind and Flush Five do not contain a Full House.
A poker hand's type is unaffected by the card order. For example a Straight will still count as one, even if the cards are played as 10, Ace, Queen, King, Jack. This makes it useful with Jokers like  Hanging Chad, so certain cards in the scoring order can maximize their potential.
In older versions, it was possible for poker hands to be decreased to Level 0, by playing a hand of Level 1 during  The Arm. This was changed to no longer be possible in 1.0.0k.
Unlike most Poker Hands that level up through the use of a Planet Card, the "Royal Flush" instead levels up alongside the "Straight Flush".
