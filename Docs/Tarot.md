Tarot Cards are a form of consumable you can obtain during a run. They can be acquired via Arcana Packs, Purple Seals, and the Shop.

Tarot Cards are used to modify the cards in in your deck, such as changing their suit or rank. They are also capable of giving cards Enhancements, or additional effects, like giving extra chips or multiplier when scored. Some give cash, generate new jokers, or even create more consumables. There are 22 different Tarot Cards available, and they unlock when purchased or used in an unseeded run.

Usage notes
 The Wheel of Fortune has a 12.5% chance of giving Foil, 8.75% chance for Holographic, and a 3.75% chance of Polychrome, which add up to 25% (or a 1/4 chance). The number of jokers you have that Wheel could apply to does not change the probability of it working. The Wheel will not apply to any Joker that already has an edition (including Negative). It also cannot be used if all Jokers already have an edition, and its Use button will be disabled.
 The Hermit does nothing if you are at or below $0 (for example, with  Credit Card, or  The Tooth Blind.)
If  Death is used on the automatically-selected card in the  Cerulean Bell Boss Blind, the card converted will also stay permanently selected until played or discarded.
When using  The World,  The Sun,  The Star or  The Moon to convert cards, the rank and enhancements on the chosen cards remains unchanged.
Tarot, like other Jokers and Consumables, can't have duplicates in the shop or Booster Packs without  Showman. If all 22 Tarots are blocked, subsequent Tarot spawned will always be  Strength.
The  Tarot Merchant and  Tarot Tycoon Vouchers can help you gain more Tarot Cards by making them more likely to appear in the Shop.
