There are 15 Decks in Balatro that contain playing cards that are key to forming poker hands. Each deck changes gameplay by having varying degrees of effects and need to be unlocked through different means. The player must choose which deck to use at the start of every run, as well as their starting Stake. Higher Stakes need to be unlocked sequentially for each individual Deck by completing the highest available stake for each deck. For example, a player must use and win with Red Deck on every single stake from White to Orange to unlock the Gold Stake. The same must be done for each of the remaining decks. The deck will also receive a Sticker of the corresponding Stake color.

There are also 20 Challenge Decks available, that each have their own specific modifiers, rules, and restrictions. They can only be played on White Stake.

Decks
The first deck available to players is the  Red Deck. The four additional color decks are unlocked by discovering items from the collection (Jokers, consumable cards, tags, vouchers, and so on), and the remaining decks are unlocked by winning with each of those five decks, or by winning with any deck with a specific Stake selected.
