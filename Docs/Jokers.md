Jokers are the face of Balatro's gameplay. They hold a significant importance in score generation and provide a multitude of other perks and utilities, such as giving money or creating consumable items like Tarot Cards, Planets, and in some cases Spectral Cards, or in the specific case of  Riff-Raff, other Jokers. Jokers are not played alongside standard cards or included in Decks, but rather can be purchased in the Shop or sometimes obtained through other means. They are held in the player's dedicated Joker slots until sold or destroyed.

Every non-challenge run, except those on  Black Deck and  Painted Deck, will begin with 5 empty Joker slots. Spectral Cards, Editions (as explained below), or deck effects like those previously mentioned may allow the player to gain or lose some of these Joker slots. Every Joker is unique and can be used in many ways to create synergy with other Jokers' effects, deck composition, consumables, or all three. Jokers are almost always a requirement to meet the required score of blinds, especially in higher antes, where the required score to defeat each Blind grows exponentially.

As of update 1.0.1o-FULL, there are 150 total Jokers in Balatro. 105 of these are readily accessible upon the player's very first run, but the remaining 45 must be unlocked through the completion of certain conditions, some of which can only be done over the course of multiple runs.

The appearance rates of the four Joker rarities are: Common – 70%. Uncommon – 25%. Rare – 5%. Legendary – only a 0.3% chance of appearing in Spectral/Arcana Packs.

After winning a run by beating the Boss blind of ante 8, the Jokers the player has at that time will receive a Sticker colour of the Stake it was used to win on. The colour in the collection will be of the highest stake the Joker was used. For example, after beating Orange Stake, a  Hiker with no sticker will receive the  Orange Stake sticker, while beating Red Stake with a  Swashbuckler with the  Purple Stake sticker will not give it a  Red Stake sticker. Instead, it will preserve the Purple Stake sticker.

Various editions as displayed in the Collection.
All Jokers start at the Base Edition, which can then be enhanced with one of the four different editions, resulting in higher shop costs but adding an additional effect listed below:

 Base (standard card)
 Foil (+50 Chips)
 Holographic (+10 Mult)
 Polychrome (X1.5 Mult)
 Negative (+1 Joker slot)
In higher stakes, Jokers can also appear with the  Eternal,  Perishable, and/or  Rental stickers. These stickers, unlike Stake stickers, affect how Jokers behave. The appearance rate of these modifiers can be found here.

Rarities
Jokers have 4 different rarities, denoting how likely they are to appear in a given run: Common (61), Uncommon (64), Rare (20), and Legendary (5). In general, higher rarity jokers are more powerful, but this is not always the case.

When the game randomly generates Jokers, either in the shop or using other joker generation methods, there is a 70% chance of generating a Common Joker, a 25% chance of generating an Uncommon Joker, and a 5% chance of generating a Rare Joker. Legendary Jokers can't appear in the shop, but only through  The Soul Spectral card.

Important Joker Terms
Jokers have a number of key terms that are vital in understanding how they work. These terms are marked with different colors, and by looking at them the player can gain a better understanding of how the joker functions, in case the wording is not clear to them:

When Scored: The effect triggers when a card is scored. If a card that is played can trigger this Joker, but is not scored, either from not being part of the scored poker hand or from being debuffed by a Boss Blind, the effect will not trigger.
Contains: The hand has the referenced hand as a part of it. For example, a Three of a Kind "contains" a Pair, despite scoring as a Three of a Kind. A Four of a Kind played with five cards of the same suit "contains" a Flush, and will trigger Flush Joker effects. Refer to the hand information in-game for a more detailed breakdown on which hands contain others. Notably, a Four of a Kind is not considered to "contain" Two Pair, since Two Pair requires two different ranks to be counted. The same can be said for Five of a Kind and Full House, or Flush Five and Flush House.
Is: In contrast, "poker hand is a pair" means the whole hand is classified as a pair, and the cards played don't constitute a higher-ranked hand.
When Blind is Selected: The effect triggers when you select a Blind. It will not trigger if the Blind is skipped. In the case of  Madness, it only triggers on the Small Blind and Big Blind, hence showing "When Small Blind or Big Blind is Selected".
In Deck: The effect depends on the remaining cards in your deck, not including cards in hand, played, or discarded.
In Full Deck: This counts some attribute of your complete deck, referencing all cards whether they were drawn, played, discarded, or are held in hand. For the specific case of  Erosion, this counts how many cards have been removed from the original deck.
Add: Adds a playing card to your deck permanently.
Destroy: Remove the target card permanently. If a Joker is destroyed, no money or bonuses are gained that selling it would give.
Create: Creates a certain type of card, be it a consumable or Joker. This action always requires room for the card in question to take up, with the sole exception of  Perkeo being able to create Negative consumables.
Gains: Adds a (usually) permanent effect to the target card. This is usually referring to the Joker with the effect, though not always, as seen with  Hiker.
Retrigger: This Joker will score a card again under certain conditions outlined by the Joker. This extra score will activate all effects that take place when the card scores, including effects from other Jokers, enhancements, editions, seals (besides Red Seal), and chips from the card itself. Note that  Mime only retriggers cards held in hand, and so it will not retrigger editions or chips from the card itself, as the card is not being played and scoring.
Debuffed: This Joker and its edition can no longer trigger. It retains its full sell value (and can still be used by Swashbuckler/Temperance/etc...). It can still be targeted by random effects such as  Madness or  The Wheel of Fortune, but not by the  Crimson Heart Boss blind. Joker effects that trigger on certain other Jokers, like  Baseball Card does, still trigger even if the other Joker is debuffed.
(Also see Activation type and Activation sequence for additional information.)

List of Jokers
Available Jokers are shown as Not Discovered in the player's Collection until they are obtained at least once in an unseeded run. Most locked Jokers in the Collection show the unlock condition, and in some cases will show how close the player is to fulfilling that condition if the condition is accumulative. The five secret Legendary Jokers, unlocked when obtained through  The Soul Spectral card, show up as "?????" in the Collection when not unlocked. Details about each Joker, such as their interactions, synergies, strategies, and exceptions, can be found on that Joker's respective page.

Usage Notes
Jokers are usually obtained through the Shop or Buffoon Packs. Other means include:
Using the  Judgement tarot card,  The Soul or  Wraith spectral card to create a Joker.
 Riff-Raff can create up to 2 common Jokers for each blind selected.
 Ankh can create a copy of a random Joker, at the cost of destroying all other destructible Jokers. This means that Ankh can't destroy Eternal Jokers.
The  Top-up Tag can create up to 2 common Jokers if you have space. The  Uncommon Tag and  Rare Tag generate a random Joker of their respective rarity when entering the Shop or rerolling.
A duplicate Joker cannot spawn during the run if it already exists on screen, unless you have  Showman.
Exceptions to this are duplicating an already owned Joker by using  Ankh or  Invisible Joker.
If all unlocked Jokers of a specific rarity exist on the screen, every subsequent Joker instance of that rarity seen in the Shop or created using Joker generation (such as  Judgement) will be replaced by  Joker.
Retroactively adding modifiers to Jokers can only be done through  The Wheel of Fortune,  Ectoplasm, or  Hex.
 Hone and  Glow Up make it more likely to find Jokers with editions in the Shop.
Skipping a Blind for the  Holographic Tag,  Polychrome Tag,  Negative Tag, or  Foil Tag can guarantee an edition on a Joker in the next Shop.
Joker slots begin at 5 most of the time, but there are exceptions and various ways to modify this.
Purchasing  Blank, and then  Antimatter will let you gain +1 joker slot.
 Painted Deck only starts with 4 joker slots. The Cruelty and Blast Off Challenge Decks reduce joker slots as well, to 3 and 4 respectively.
 Black Deck has an additional joker slot, for a total of 6. The Five-Card Draw Challenge Deck also increases joker slots, to 7.
Having Negative Jokers allows you to have a Joker that gives an extra joker slot, essentially not taking up a slot.
The Jokerless Challenge Deck bans all methods of obtaining jokers and sets joker slots to 0, making it impossible to use any. The Typecast Challenge Deck also sets joker slots to 0, but only after Ante 4.
Jokers, like every other purchasable consumable or playing card, only need to be purchased once to be "discovered", even if the action is cancelled by quitting and reloading the save.
This can be taken advantage of by selling run-winning Jokers, then buying undiscovered ones, quitting to the Main Menu, and loading the run again to undo the purchase while still having new Jokers discovered for their collection.
