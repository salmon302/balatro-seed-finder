Tags are rewards you can receive for skipping a  Small Blind or  Big Blind. Depending on the type of tag, it may trigger immediately or it may not trigger until a certain gamestate or condition is met (for example, the next time you visit the Shop). There are 24 different Tags available, with only 15 being available in Ante 1. The player can keep stacking multiple Tags until they're used. The Tags will trigger starting from the oldest tag acquired and the newest one will be the last. In-game, the Tags are displayed with the newest on the top of the stack.

The  Diet Cola Joker and the  Anaglyph Deck are the only other way to create a tag, specifically, the  Double Tag. Although, it is technically possible to create a Double Tag by using  Blueprint or  Brainstorm to copy Diet Cola, and then sell them.

The chance for each Tag to appear is the same. The same Tag can appear multiple times during a single run and even during the same Ante. However, during Ante 1, the  Negative Tag,  Standard Tag,  Meteor Tag,  Buffoon Tag,  Handy Tag,  Garbage Tag,  Ethereal Tag,  Top-up Tag, and  Orbital Tag cannot be encountered.

Five Tags also have a hidden unlock requirement: for the  Rare Tag you need to have discovered  Blueprint, and for the  Negative Tag,  Foil Tag,  Holographic Tag and  Polychrome Tag you need to have discovered their respective editions.

List of Tags
Tag	Name	Benefit	Notes	Ante
	Uncommon	The next shop will have a free Uncommon Joker.	
The Joker is extra generated, and guaranteed to appear in next shop, which is not affected by Vouchers that relatively lower the weight of Jokers in Shop (see The Shop#Vouchers), or certain Challenges that Jokers' spawn rate is set to 0. Can be stacked with Edition Tags, generating a free Joker with Editions.

	Rare	The next shop will have a free Rare Joker.	1
	Negative	The next base edition Joker you find in a Shop becomes Negative (+1 joker slot) and free.	
If there are no base edition Jokers in the next shop, these Tags will instead be stored. Works with Uncommon and Rare Tag if the generated Joker doesn't have an Edition naturally. Can be stacked on one shop until there are no base edition Jokers.

If your balance is negative your money is not doubled, instead giving you $0 and essentially wasting the tag.

Synergies
Continually skipping  Small Blinds and  Big Blinds to acquire Tags works well with  Throwback, since that joker gains X0.25 Mult for each skipped blind.
Jokers that benefit from less hands and/or rounds played can benefit from skipping as well.
This includes Jokers that can have diminishing returns as the run goes on like:  Popcorn,  Turtle Bean,  Ice Cream, etc.
Jokers that have Perishable stickers that are key to a build can be persevered longer by skipping more blinds.
