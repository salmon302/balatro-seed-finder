Planet Cards are a type of consumable you can obtain throughout a run. They can be obtained through Celestial Packs, Blue Seals, two specific Tarot cards, and the Shop.

Planet Cards can level up their associated poker hand type by increasing the base value of chips and multiplier. Generally, the more difficult a hand is to play, the more chips and multiplier will be added from the Planet Card. There is no limit to how many times you can level up your poker hand. Poker hand levels are only kept for the duration of the run, and are reset each time you start a new one.

There are 12 different cards, however three of them -  Eris,  Ceres, and  Planet X - are secret and not initially available through the methods mentioned above. There are no unlock conditions for Planet Cards, with the exception of the three secret planet cards, which can only be found in the shop after playing their associated poker hand type, and only for the rest of that specific run.

Discovering all 12 Planet Cards unlocks the  Astronomer Joker.
